    "description": "<article><h1>Brain-Computer Interfaces</h1><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are creating direct communication pathways between neural activity and external devices. Non-invasive systems using EEG headsets already enable basic control of computers and prosthetics. Invasive implants with hundreds of electrodes allow paralyzed individuals to type or control robotic arms with their thoughts. Emerging technologies aim to restore vision, hearing and movement for people with disabilities.</p><p>The field is advancing rapidly. Neuralink and other companies are developing minimally invasive high-bandwidth interfaces. Flexible, biocompatible materials reduce immune response to implants. AI algorithms better decode neural patterns into intended actions. Closed-loop systems provide sensory feedback, creating bidirectional communication.</p><p>Beyond medical applications, BCIs raise fascinating possibilities. Augmented cognition could enhance memory or learning speed. Direct brain-to-brain communication might one day enable thought sharing. Military applications explore situational awareness enhancement. However, these raise significant ethical concerns about privacy, identity and cognitive liberty.</p><p>Technical hurdles remain. Implant longevity is limited by tissue response. Non-invasive methods lack precision. Fully understanding the brain's neural code is enormously complex. Scaling electrode counts while minimizing damage presents engineering challenges. Wireless power and data transmission need improvement for practical use.</p><p>As BCIs develop, society must grapple with profound questions. How should we regulate neural data privacy? What constitutes consent for cognitive enhancement? How might unequal access to neurotechnology affect social equity? While the technology holds tremendous promise for treating neurological conditions, its broader implications require careful consideration by scientists, ethicists and policymakers.</p></article>"
