    "description": "<article><h1>Mobility in the 21st Century</h1><p>Transportation systems worldwide are undergoing their most significant transformation since the automobile replaced horse-drawn carriages. Electric vehicle adoption is accelerating rapidly, with battery costs falling 90% in the past decade. Charging infrastructure is expanding, while solid-state batteries promise faster charging and greater range. Some countries have announced bans on internal combustion engine vehicles as early as 2030.</p><p>Autonomous vehicle technology continues to advance, though full self-driving capability remains challenging in complex urban environments. Shared mobility services like ride-hailing and microtransit are changing ownership models. Urban air mobility concepts envision electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for intracity transport.</p><p>Smart city initiatives integrate transportation with other urban systems. Mobility-as-a-service platforms combine multiple modes into seamless trips. Connected vehicle technologies enable communication between cars and infrastructure to improve safety and traffic flow. Micromobility options like e-scooters and e-bikes address last-mile challenges.</p><p>These changes bring both opportunities and challenges. Reduced emissions improve urban air quality, but increased vehicle miles traveled could offset some benefits. Job displacement in driving occupations requires workforce transition programs. Cybersecurity risks emerge as vehicles become more connected. Land use patterns may need to adapt to new mobility paradigms.</p><p>The coming decades will likely see a mix of technological solutions tailored to different contexts. Dense cities may emphasize shared and active transportation, while rural areas might rely more on autonomous vehicles. Integrating these innovations equitably and sustainably will be crucial for creating transportation systems that serve all members of society.</p></article>"
